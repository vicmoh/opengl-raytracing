If you need help running the program please do contact me.

This program is using a data struct library that I created.
Reference: https://github.com/vicmoh/dynamic-string-api 

# How to run

Make sure you have `make` install and working.
Compiling and running the program:
* `make FILE="./assets/file.txt"`

To compile type `make FILE="./assets/file.txt`, this
will compile and run your program at the same time.
You must assign the `FILE` value with existing file and
directory. If it does not exist, it will tell you at 
the console. Press `q` to quit.
